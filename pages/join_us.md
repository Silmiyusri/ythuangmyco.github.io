The Huang lab is always looking for motivated undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs to join the lab. Please e-mail ythuangmyco@gmail.com or ythuangmyco@kmu.edu.tw if you are interested in joining us.

The Huang lab is housed in the [Department of Biomedical Science and Environmental Biology](https://biology.kmu.edu.tw/index.php/zh-TW/) at Kaohsiung Medical School.

Graduate students
<hr/>


I will consider accepting a student to start in fall 2021. If you are interested in working on community ecology and feeling "stupid" about it, you may be a good fit in our lab. Depending on their experience, interests, and career goals, some of my students choose to collaborate with me directly on one of the projects I am heavily involved in. Some others work on projects not directly related to my core interests. Yet others initially work on one of the projects led directly by me and later transition into more independent projects. In all cases, I encourage my students to find, design, and execute their research on their own, with me as a collaborator. I believe this approach helps them to become independent and creative scientists.

Undergraduate students
<hr/>

Students are welcome to participate in the research conducted in our lab throughout the year. We often have funded opportunities in summer.

<h4>Post-doctoral fellows</h4>
<hr/>
I encourage potential postdocs to apply for independent funding. Meanwhile, I am happy to help brainstorm ideas for collaborative proposals. If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, email me and we can talk about funding opportunities.
