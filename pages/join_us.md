The Huang lab is always looking for motivated undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs to join the lab. Please e-mail ythuangmyco@gmail.com or ythuangmyco@kmu.edu.tw if you are interested in joining us.

The Huang lab is housed in the [Department of Biomedical Science and Environmental Biology](https://biology.kmu.edu.tw/index.php/zh-TW/) at Kaohsiung Medical School.<br>
Lab: 932<br>
Office: 933<br>

<h4>Graduate students</h4>
<hr/>
My goal is train graduate students to become independent, high quality scientists. I encourage students to find, design, and execute their research on their own, with me as a collaborator. If you are interested in microbial ecology, insects, or symbiosis, please send me an email introducing yourself, your previous research experience and with a resume or CV attached.

<h4>Undergraduate students</h4>
<hr/>
Students are welcome to participate in the research conducted in the lab throughout the year.

<h4>Post-doctoral fellows</h4>
<hr/>
I encourage potential postdocs to apply for independent funding. Meanwhile, I am happy to help brainstorm ideas for collaborative proposals. If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, email me and we can talk about funding opportunities.
