我是黃尹則！我的研究以真菌、昆蟲和植物作為素材，探討生物間的共生關係。我結合傳統、分子的採樣及統計分析的方式，來了解生物間有趣且複雜的共生關係。除了研究外，攝影與健行也是我的最愛。<br>

My name is Yin-Tse Huang. I study symbiosis, using fungi, beetles, and plants as my model systems. I combine conventional/molecular sampling methods and statistical analysis approaches to help understanding the fasinating though often complicated symbiotic relationships among organisms. In addition to research, I am a fan of photography and hiking.
