The Huang lab is always looking for motivated undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs to join the lab. Please e-mail [ythuangmyco@gmail.com](ythuangmyco@gmail.com) or [ythuangmyco@kmu.edu.tw](ythuangmyco@kmu.edu.tw) if you are interested in joining us.

The Huang lab is housed in the [Department of Biomedical Science and Environmental Biology](https://biology.kmu.edu.tw/index.php/zh-TW/) at Kaohsiung Medical School.<br>
Lab: 932<br>
Office: 933<br>

<h4>Graduate students</h4>
<hr/>
My goal is to train graduate students to become independent, high quality scientists. I encourage students to find, design, and execute research independently, and with me as a collaborator. If you are interested in microbial ecology and insects-fungi symbiosis, please send me an email introducing yourself, your previous research experience with CV attached. Let's talk about potential projects that are of interest to both of us.

<h4>Undergraduate students</h4>
<hr/>
Students are welcome to participate in the research conducted in the lab throughout the year. Please send me an email introducing yourself and your previous research experience. 

<h4>Post-doctoral fellows</h4>
<hr/>
I encourage potential postdocs to apply for independent funding. Meanwhile, I am happy to help brainstorm ideas for collaborative proposals. If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, email me and we can talk about funding opportunities.
