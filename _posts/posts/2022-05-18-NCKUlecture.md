Yin-Tse Huang was invited to give a lecture on introducing the ambrosia symbiosis in the class, Biology and Genetics of Fungi, hosted by [Pedro Gon√ßalves](https://www.goncalves-lab.com/home). 
We had a very interactive class and hands-on labratory observation on fungal specimens! Much appreciated for the invitation.<br>
