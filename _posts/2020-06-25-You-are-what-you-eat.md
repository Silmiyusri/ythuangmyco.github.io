The relationships between wood-boring ambrosia beetles and the fungi which they farm as their sole source of food have long been of interest to anyone concerned with maintaining healthy forests. With millions of years of history between the insects and their fungi, it has been generally assumed that each member of the symbiosis was highly adapted to one another. But a new study by the University of Florida's Forest Entomology Lab suggests that the metabolisms of the fungi started out working just as they have continued.

The hundreds of species of ambrosia beetles, which independently arose from weevils at least fourteen times in evolutionary history, normally chew tunnels through dead or dying trees in which the fungi that they carry with them begin to grow and provide a source of food. But sometimes invasive populations of the beetles attack living trees en mass, causing mass deaths of the trees. The threat that some ambrosia beetles can pose to wildlife habitat and industries ranging from avocados to paper has made them an important subject of research.

Dr. Yin-Tse Huang of the UF Forest Entomology Lab led an effort to analyze the metabolic pathways of three lineages of ambrosia fungi and compare them to their closest non-beetle-farmed relatives. Surprisingly, he found that their metabolisms hadn't changed since establishing relationships with the beetles.

"This result showed that, metabolically, ambrosia fungi have different evolutionary paths to be adopted as the fungal crops," Dr. Huang said.

An organism's metabolism is regulated by molecules called enzymes, which act as catalysts to speed up chemical reactions necessary to sustain life. Closely analyzing the chemicals present in an organism can be a way of understanding its metabolic ability to convert food (wood, in this case) into new compounds necessary to thrive and reproduce.

Dr. Huang identified three separate pairs of species of fungi, with each pair consisting of a beetle-farmed fungus and it's non-farmed relative. He put samples of the various fungi through a mass spectrometer in order to see exactly what molecules were present. 

"To be honest, it was a bit unexpected to find no apparent compounds that emerged in ambrosia fungi, given the fact that they have had such a long co-evolution history with the beetles,‚Äù Dr. Huang said.


"On the other hand, it does highlight the great divergence of ecological niches and phylogenetic origins of ambrosia fungi," Dr. Huang said. "A conserved metabolism inherited from their ancestors which might have been optimized for distinct niches would be a rational and safe strategy for fungi. In fact, the functional redundancy has been shown in many associated fungi in ambrosia symbiosis. It indicates that the nutritional-oriented evolution of fungi to feed the vector beetles may not be that strongly enforced in the ambrosia system."
